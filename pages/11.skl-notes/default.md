DevPanel is a control panel for developers. It automates many day-to-day DevOps tasks for developers working on web sites/apps.

DevPanel is tightly integrated with AWS and Github so it's ideal for managing the entire development lifecycle of sites and apps involving multiple teams and can manage thousands of sites and hundreds of developers.
