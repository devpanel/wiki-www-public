            title: 'Why is it not FREE?'
            text: "Sorry! We're not venture backed. We don't have loads of cash. This project took a lot of money to develop and it takes money to operate. We're giving you a LOT of value for YOUR money... if you like it, then support us. We're saving you hundreds and thousands of hours and so many mistakes. We're constantly improving and adding new features. We're always experimenting with brand new AWS features to get YOU more value out of AWS. We setup auto-scaling clusters and use spot instances for you - all to save YOU money. <u>We're NOT trying to squeeze money from you... we're trying to deliver value.</u> With us, you'll save money every time AWS drops its prices or comes out with new technology! \r\n\r\nMost of our stuff is open sourced... everything from Jenkins down. So in fact, if you want it for free, go download the [open source version](https://github.com/devpanel/?target=_blank), it works, use it... but then help fix things and contribute back! that's how it works! that's how you pay back! That's fair, right? and you know, do this, and you'll even make a few good friends along the way.\r\n\r\nBut seriously, try DevPanel. Use the Free Trial. See if you like it... and if you like it, then support us.\r\n\r\n[Salim](/about)"

            title: 'Does DevPanel include AWS costs? GitHub costs? and cost of external tools?'
            text: "No, it doesn't. Think of the DevPanel fees as the price you're paying for saving you a ton of time and making sure things are done the right way. If you try and do the things we do for you by hand, it will take you hours and hours - and sometimes days; really! So we're charging for the convinence - we're not paying for your other stuff :-) You pay AWS, GitHub and others for what you use - and you pay them directly. We don't get in the middle of it. We don't take a cut. \r\n\r\nYou can't expect more fair pricing than this. Can you? \r\n\r\n[Salim](/about)\r\n"

            title: 'Can I get a refund if I cancel?'
            text: "IDK, what's fair? how about a refund of your last month's payment? say auto-pay kicked in and you're kicking yourself for not kicking us out sooner, then you can tell us and we'll give you last month's payment back. Or we can pro-rate it. That would be fair too, I guess, if you pre-paid for the annual plan. Well, either way, tell us what you think would be fair, and we'll do our best to separate with dignity.\r\n\r\n[Salim](/about)\r\n\r\n"
