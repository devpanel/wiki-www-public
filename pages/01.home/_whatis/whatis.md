title: 'What is DevPanel?'
description: "Have you used Pantheon速, Acquia速, Platform.sh速 or WPengine速 ? it's like that. \r\n\r\n<u>Instead of marking up Google or AWS hosting, we run on top of your own AWS account.</u> We simply charge you for the convenience that our control panel provides you. All the backend software is open source too... so if you stop paying us, your apps/sites don't go down. \r\n\r\n<u>As a \"B Corp,\" we focus on delivering value.</u> Our business model is very different than the other companies in this space. We don't have institutional investors. <u>YOU, our customers, are our investors</u>. So you get all the value of our work. We're not obligated to make loads of money for our investors. We're obligated to provide you value. We will continue to do this as long as we have your support. \r\n\r\nThis is DevPanel.\r\n"
