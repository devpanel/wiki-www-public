1. Inside a Workspace or Server, click "Create Application"
2. Give it a name, pick a server, give it an admin password, etc. and click Save
3. You'll be notified when the app is built for you
4. Look for a URL for that app - it'll end with *devpanel.net*
5. Go to that URL and login as admin and check it everything is working OK for you
6. You can keep using this URL or you can change it to your custom URL if you like
